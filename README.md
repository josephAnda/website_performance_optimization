## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project V 2.0

HOW TO RUN:
Navigate to the project directory in terminal/command line and open the 'index.html' file in your browser.
(type 'open index.html').  

ABOUT:
This directory houses the source code for an optimized portfolio website (project 4 from Udacity.com's Front-End Developer track).  The modifications to the resources were completed by Joseph Anda.

CHANGES SINCE LAST VERSION:
*Moved DOM-interacting variables outside of loops
*Dynamically calculated the number of rows of pizzas to be rendered
*Used 'getElementsByClassName' rather than querySelectorAll
*Smoothed out the code for determining the argument of the sine function
*Using strict mode to throw an error when questionable syntax rears its ugly head
*Function added as a cross-browser height-finder, but not currently in use.  The 
function remains in the code for future potential use . . . 


NOTES:
Commentary about addional functions and rearranged variable declarations are included in 'views/js/main.js' where they appear for clarity.
